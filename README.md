# Blindness-Detection-using-MobileNetV2

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting blindness using the MobileNetV2 architecture. The model is trained on a specific dataset to identify signs of blindness in images.

# Dataset:

You are provided with a large set of retina images taken using fundus photography under a variety of imaging conditions.A clinician has rated each image for the severity of diabetic retinopathy on a scale of 0 to 4:

0 - No DR,
1 - Mild,
2 - Moderate,
3 - Severe,
4 - Proliferative DR.

Like any real-world data set, you will encounter noise in both the images and labels. Images may contain artifacts, be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed. The images were gathered from multiple clinics using a variety of cameras over an extended period of time, which will introduce further variation.
